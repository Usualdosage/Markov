Builds a Markov chain using an Elastic Search data set and query result. This work initially started
after reviewing Jason Bury's article "Using Javascript and Markov Chains to Generate Text" available at 
http://www.soliantconsulting.com/blog/2013/02/draft-title-generator-using-markov-chains. Although little
of that work remains (array randomizer is about it), his work inspired me to create this, so shout out
to him. Other functions are used with permission and credited where due. The text provided for the
data sets are publicly available works by the late and great Douglas Adams. In order to utilize this
code, you will need a local (or online) instance of Elasticsearch running. You can download Elasticsearch
by visiting https://elastic.co.
All other work was created by Matthew Martin (UsualDosage/Dreaminhex).
